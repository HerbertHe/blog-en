# About

Hey visitor~ðŸ‘‹

I am Herbert He, an open source developer who had contributed to serval projects. Now I am a Collegiate Volunteer to China's Far West Program, and serve for the Bureau of Statistics of Mori Kazakh Autonomous County.

Before, I always share ideas in Qzone or WeChat Moments, but I DON'T most of them could understand me. And I spent too much time on build my cool blog website but a little contents within. I don't think that really help me to express myself but waste time. Thus, I create this project and write in English only.

I am not a native English speaker, and haven't learned English for a long time. I don't think it is hard for me to learn English, but remembering the words that I dont't use often is really frustrating to some extent. So I created the language environment here for myself to practice, hope I can meet my goal.
